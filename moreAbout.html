            <p>
                An up and coming full stack developer as well as a hobby digital artist. Hi, my name is <strong>Alyssa Allera</strong>, currently taking up a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology at Polytechnic University of the Philippines Manila Branch.
                As a student, I still a lot to learn to be able to call myself a professional.

            <h3>Alyssa as a Web Developer</h3>
            <p>
                Being in the IT field can be overwhelming, especially if you're surrounded by people who has a better understanding on how things are done.
                Like a small goldfish in the middle of a thriving coral reef filled with glamorous fishes of different kinds. That is how I summarize my first few years in this course.
                Not a really great start if I may say so myself. But I guess that is just how a normal person would feel whenever they're stepping on a land that they are not familiar with.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overwhelmingly scary yet <em>fun</em>. I guess that is how I could describe my experience with Web Development. To be honest,
                I haven't really understood how to program something until recently, during my thesis subject where I was forced to study how things should work.
                Having to blindly navigate thru stackoverflow to find the answer for a simple question, it was really hard. But once the codes start to run
                and havning the sense of achievement when it ran successfully, I really enjoyed that feeling. I still couldn't believe I enjoyed those sleepless nights
                just cause a simple function ran successfully.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was hard, stressful and tear jerking but I enjoyed it. Just that thought made me want to continue on persuing this line of work.

            <h3>Alyssa as a Digital Artist</h3>
            <p>
                My artist name is <i>shiitakeee</i> and I mostly post art on social medias like Twitter, FaceBook and Instagram.
                I have always liked art ever since I was a child. It has only been 5 years when I first started trying out digital art, so I'd say I'm more of an artist than a web developer. 
                Although I cannot say my art was the best back then, cause it wasn't. But that's how people learn, thru constant failures and bad output. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I actually have tried doing freelance work as a digital artist before, but that didn't last long due to my poor schedule management. Right now, I'm more of a
                hobby artist, just making occasional art during my free time
